# SQL Task: Create a Simple E-commerce System

## Objective
The goal of this project is to design and implement a database structure to manage a simple e-commerce system. The system will consist of three tables: `customers`, `orders`, and `products`. Each table will serve a distinct role in the management of customer data, product information, and order tracking.

### Table Overview:
- **Customers**: Stores customer information like name, email, and address.
- **Orders**: Tracks orders placed by customers, including the order date and total amount.
- **Products**: Contains details about the products available for purchase, including name, price, and description.
